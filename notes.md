// In this project you will learn basic string and array methods by building a music player app. You will be able to play, pause, skip, and shuffle songs.
// you'll learn about the Web Audio API and how to use it to play songs. All modern browsers support the Web Audio API, which lets you generate and process audio in web applications.
// The spread operator (...) allows you to copy all elements from one array into another. It can also be used to concatenate multiple arrays into one.
// you will learn how to add new HTML for each song using the map() method. This method will be explained in more detail in the next step.
// The map() method is used to iterate through an array and return a new array. It's helpful when you want to create a new array based on the values of an existing array. the map() method takes a function as an argument. This is called a callback function, which is a function that is passed to another function as an argument.
// Template literals are literals delimited with backtick ( ` ) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, string interpolation with embedded expressions, and special constructs called tagged templates
// The join() method is used to concatenate all the elements of an array into a single string. It takes an optional parameter called a separator which is used to separate each element of the array.
// Optional chaining (?.) helps prevent errors when accessing nested properties that might be null or undefined.
// The find() method retrieves the first element within an array that fulfills the conditions specified in the provided callback function. If no element satisfies the condition, the method returns undefined.
// The forEach method is used to loop through an array and perform a function on each element of the array. For example, suppose you have an array of numbers and you want to log each number to the console.
// Use the filter() method to remove the song object that matches the id parameter from the userData?.songs array. The filter method keeps only the elements of an array that satisfy the callback function passed to it.
// createElement() is a DOM method you can use to dynamically create an element using JavaScript. To use createElement(), you call it, then pass in the tag name as a string
// The createTextNode() method is used to create a text node. To use it, you call it and pass in the text as a string
// appendChild() lets you add a node or an element as the child of another element. In the example below, the text "Click me" would be attached to the button
